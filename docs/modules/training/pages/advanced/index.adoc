== What you will learn in this course
    - How to configure feelpp.benchmarking to overcome common benchmarking challenges
    - How to create custom figures to visualize benchmarking results
    - How to create a continuous benchmarking workflow


When benchmarking applications on HPC systems, multiple challenges arise. For example,

- how does one guarantees reproducibility of an application across different systems?
- how to compare the performance of an application across different systems?
- how do I handle large input datasets and memory requirements?

This course will teach you how to use _feelpp.benchmarking_ to overcome these challenges.
