= Introduction to ReFrame-HPC and initial benchmark setups

:toc:

== Context

=== Overview of HPC systems and challenges
    - Scaling and energy efficiency

=== Importance of benchmarking and regression testing in HPC environments
    - Reproducibility, consistency and system reliability
    - Continuous benchmarking

== Benchmarking fundamentals

    - Best practices

== ReFrame-HPC

=== What is Reframe-HPC?

=== Key features for performance envaluation and regression testing.

=== ReFrame Configuration
    - Installation
    - Systems, partitions, environments
    - System specific parameters (modules, schedulers, options, ...)
    - Integration with containers

=== Designing Regression Tests
    - Test pipeline overview (stages and how reframe executes tests async/serial)
    - Setup and parameterization
    - Performance measuring
    - Sanity checks and performance validation
