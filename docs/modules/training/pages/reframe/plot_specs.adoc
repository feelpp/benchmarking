= Figure specifications

The final configuration file that must be provided to the _feelpp.benchmarking_ framework is the plot specifications file. This file contains the information necessary to generate the plots that will be displayed in the report.

It has a flexible syntax that allows users to build figures depending on the benchmark parameters.

The file should contain a single field: `plots`, which is a list of *Plot* objects.

The figures will appear in the report in the order they are defined in the file.

Users should specify the plot type and which data to use for different axis.

Additionally, a `transformation` field can be provided to apply a transformation to the data before plotting. For example, users can apply a `speedup` transformation.

            "color_axis":{"parameter":"algorithm","label":"Algorithm"}
        }
    ]
}

This configuration will generate a scatter plot with the execution time on the y-axis and the number of elements on the x-axis. The color of the points will represent the algorithm used for sorting.

[NOTE]
====
Many plot types are supported. Some of them can take an arbitrary number of parameters by using the `extra_axes` field.
