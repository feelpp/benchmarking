= Text Node

The **Text Node** is used to insert narrative content into your report. It supports both fixed, **static** text blocks and **dynamic** content that integrates processed values directly from loaded data files.


|===
|Field|Type|Description|Default Value

|`type`|string|Must be set to `"text"`.|`"text"`
|`text`|string or object|The text content or a nested `Text` object.|*Required*
|`data`|string|The `name` / reference of the data field to use for dynamic placeholder resolution.|`null`

|===

== Text Configuration (Nested Object)

If you need to override the default dynamic behavior (e.g., change the placeholder delimiters), you can use the detailed configuration object instead of a raw string for the `text` field.

|===
|Field|Type|Description|Default Value

|`content`|string|The text string containing the narrative and any placeholders.|*Required*
|`mode`|string (`"static"`, `"dynamic"`)|Explicitly controls processing. If omitted, the mode is inferred based on whether placeholders are detected in the `content`.|Inferred
|`placeholder_expr`|string|The regular expression used to identify placeholders in the text.|`@{([^}]+)}@`
|===


== Static Text

Static content is the simplest form and does not require the `data` field.

[NOTE]
If the `text` field is defined as a raw string, the engine automatically treats it as static content unless placeholders are detected.

----
{
  "type":"text",
  "text":"My custom static text!"
}
----

Dynamic text uses **placeholders** (`@{...}@`) to inject data values. The content inside the placeholders follows a simple path and operator syntax.

=== Path Syntax

Use dot (`.`) notation to traverse nested data structures within the data source referenced by the `data` field.

* **Dictionary/JSON:** Use keys: `@{data_name.key.subkey}@`
* **Lists/Arrays:** Use numerical indices: `@{data_list.0.item_name}@`

=== Value Operators

Simple operators can be applied to the retrieved value using the pipe (`|`) syntax to perform common transformations directly at render-time.

|===
|Operator|Description|Example

|`length`|Returns the size of a list, array, or string.|`@{list_data \| length}@`
|===

=== Example

Assume a data file named `"results"` was loaded, containing the data: `{"version": "1.2.3", "timings": [1, 2, 3]}`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "text",
  "data": "results",
  "text": "The report was generated for version @{results.version}@. We analyzed @{results.timings | length}@ samples."
}
// Renders as: "The report was generated for version 1.2.3. We analyzed 3 samples."
