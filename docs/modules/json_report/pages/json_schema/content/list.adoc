= List Node

The **List Node** is used to render ordered lists. Its primary strength is that every item in the list is automatically processed as a potential **Dynamic Text Node**, allowing placeholders to be used in any list item.

== ListNode Schema

|===
|Field|Type|Description|Default Value

|`type`|string|Must be set to `"list"`.|`"list"`
|`items`|array of objects/strings|The contents of the list. Each entry can be a simple string, a full `Text Node` object, or a `Text Configuration` object.|*Required*
|`data`|string|The `name` / reference of the data field to use for dynamic placeholder resolution within all list items.|`null`
|===

== Item Coercion and Dynamic Text

For simplicity, the engine automatically coerces simple strings and `Text` objects provided in the `items` array into full `Text Node` objects.

* If an item is a **simple string**, it can contain **placeholders** (`@{...}@`).
* The `data` reference specified on the `ListNode` container is automatically inherited by all items, enabling dynamic text substitution for the entire list based on a single data source.

=== Example: Dynamic List

Assume a data file named `"config"` was loaded, containing: `{"user": "Alice", "tasks": ["compute", "fill", "finalize"]}`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "list",
  "data": "config",
  "items": [
    "Report generated for user: @{user}@",
    "Total tasks found: @{tasks | length}@",
    "First task: @{tasks.0}@"
  ]
}
----

When rendered, the output would be:

[source,asciidoc]
----
- Report generated for user: Alice
- Total tasks found: 3
- First task: compute
