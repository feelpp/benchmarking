The JSON Report Engine provides a robust and flexible system for generating professional, data-driven documents.

[.underline]#Declarative and Validated Configuration#

* **Single-File Report Definition:** Define the entire report structure, content order, and data processing rules using a **single, clear JSON configuration file**.
* **Guaranteed Structure:** The configuration is rigorously checked against a fixed schema, ensuring your report definition is **correct and executable** before the generation process even begins.
* **Clean Workflow:** The reporting logic is kept entirely separate from your raw data and the final document style, leading to highly maintainable and adaptable reports.

[.underline]#Powerful Data Management#

* **Multi-Source Data Loading:** Easily load and integrate data from various sources, including **CSV**, **JSON**, and **raw text** files, directly into your reporting process.
* **Custom Data Preparation:** Use a simple configuration to apply custom **Python functions** to clean, reshape, or transform your loaded data immediately before it is used in a table or figure.
* **Advanced Data Restructuring:** Configure powerful built-in transformations to prepare your data for reporting, including:
    * Filtering data rows based on precise conditions.
    * Calculating summarized values (e.g., averages, sums) by grouping results.
    * **Pivoting** and reorganizing data for cross-tabulation.

[.underline]#Flexible Output and Content#

* **Multi-Format Document Generation:** The Engine is built to support various output types, with primary support for generating highly-structured **AsciiDoc** documents (and future potential for formats like LaTeX and HTML).
* **Dynamic Content Integration:** Embed specific calculated values or data points directly into your narrative text using a simple, readable placeholder syntax, ensuring your reports are always up-to-date with the underlying data.
* **Rich Content Nodes:** Construct professional reports using a variety of specialized content blocks:
    * **Sections:** For creating hierarchical document structures.
    * **Data Tables:** Fully configurable tables with custom sorting, filtering, and style alignment.
    * **Figures and Plots:** Declarative definitions for all data visualizations.
    * **Mathematical Content:** Direct inclusion of **LaTeX** code for complex equations or symbols.
