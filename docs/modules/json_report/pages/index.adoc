= JSON Report Renderer

The **JSON Report Renderer** is a robust and flexible Python library designed to transform complex data and a declarative JSON configuration into high-quality, structured documents (such as **AsciiDoc**, with future support for LaTeX and HTML).

It functions as a **powerful middleware pipeline**, orchestrating the entire reporting workflow:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Securely loading and integrating data from diverse external sources (CSV, JSON, raw text files).
2.  **Transformation:** Applying sophisticated data manipulation using Pandas, including filtering, aggregation, pivoting, and custom preprocessing functions.
3.  **Rendering:** Utilizing Jinja2 templating to generate a cohesive document, embedding dynamic content nodes like tables, plots, and formatted text.

This approach ensures the separation of data logic from presentation, providing a highly maintainable and adaptable reporting solution.
