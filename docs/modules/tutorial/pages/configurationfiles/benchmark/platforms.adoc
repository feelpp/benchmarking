= Platforms

The `platforms` object lists all options and directories related to the benchmark execution for each supported platform. A platform present on this object does not imply that it will be benchmarked, but it rather lists all possible options.
The actual platform where tests will run is defined by either the `access` field of the machine configuration, or the `platform` field.

input_dir [*str*]::
    Indicates the directory path where input files can be found, INSIDE the given platform. For the built-in platform, it corresponds to where input files can be found on the system.

append_app_options [*List[str*]] (Optional)::
    Describes the options to pass to the application. It is equivalent to the `options` field on the configuration root. However, it is used for having different application options depending on the platform.

options [*List[str]*] (Optional)::
    Describes the options to pass to the platform launcher.
    For example, `"options":["--bind a:b"]` will be interpreted, for the apptainer platform, as `apptainer exec --bind a:b your_image.sif your_application.exe ...`

image [*Dict[str,str]*] (Conditional)::
    Contains information related to the container image.
    For any platform other than built-in, the `image` field must be specified

    -filepath [*str*]:::
        Filepath containing the location of the container image.
        If provided along the `url` field, the image will be pulled and placed here before tests are executed, otherwise the framework will assume that the image exists on the given filepath.

    -url [*str*] (Optional):::
        URL to pull the image from.
        If this field is specified, `feelpp.benchmarking` will pull the image and place it under the `filepath` field.
        If this field is not provided, the framework will assume that the image exists under `filepath`.


The `platforms` field is optional, if not provided, the builtin platform will be considered.
The syntax for builtin platform is the following:

[source,json]
----
"platforms": {
    "builtin":{
        "input_dir":"",
        "append_app_options":[]
    }
}
----

The following shows an example how to configure the Apptainer platform:

[source,json]
----
"platforms":{
    "apptainer":{
        "input_dir":"/input_data/",
        "options":["--bind /data/custom_data/:{{platforms.apptainer.input_dir}}"],
        "append_app_options":["--my_custom_option_for_apptainer"],
        "image":{
            "filepath":"/data/images/my_image.sif",
            "url":"oras://ghcr.io/your-image.sif"
        }
    }
}
----

In this case, `input_dir` represents the directory where input files will be found INSIDE the container. If there is no input data present in the container, you might need to bind a local input data directory to it, using `options`

The `options` field contains a list of all the options to include on the container execution. It is equivalent to the machine's `containers.apptainer.options` field. However, users should only include benchmark dependent options in this list.

Note that the placeholder syntax is used to tell to the container to bind a directory to the one specified in `Ã¬nput_dir`.

The `append_app_options` lists all the options to add to the application execution. It does the same as the `options` field in the root of the file, but can be used for case handling.

The image field indicates that the image should be pulled from oras://ghcr.io/your-image.sif and placed in _/data/images/my_image.sif_.

To summarize, `feelpp.benchmarking` will first execute (even before ReFrame is launched):

[source,bash]
----
apptainer pull -F /data/images/my_image.sif oras://ghcr.io/your-image.sif
----

And then, ReFrame will submit a job executing (for local scheduler):

[source,bash]
----
apptainer exec --bind /data/custom_data/:/input_data/ /data/images/my_image.sif --my_custom_option_for_apptainer
----


[TIP]
====
For the `filepath` field, it is very useful to make use of the `{{machine.containers.apptainer.image_base_dir}}` field from the machine configuration.
