= Sanity

The `sanity` field is used to validate the application execution.

The syntax is the following:

[source,json]
----
"sanity":{
    "success":[],
    "error":[]
}
----

- The `success` field contains a list of patterns to look for in the standard output. If any of the patterns are not found, the test will fail.
- The `error` field contains a list of patters that will make the test fail if found in the standard output. If any of these paterns are found, the test will fail.

[NOTE]
====
At the moment, only validating standard output is supported. It will soon be possible to specify custom log files.

== Examples

[source,json]
----
"sanity": {
    "success": ["[SUCCESS]"],
    "error": ["[OOPSIE]","Error"]
}
----

Will check if "[SUCCESS]" is found on the application's standard output. If not, the test will failt.

It will also check that neither "[OOPSIE]" nor "Error" appear in the standard output.

[TIP]
====
Regex patterns are supported.
