= feelpp.benchmarkign project

The _Feel++ benchmarking_ project provides a framework for automating, centralizing and organizing performance evaluation of scientific simulations on HPC systems.
This project, based on the https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html[ReFrame-hpc framework], enables highly customized benchmarking using robust and comprehensive JSON configuration files that parametrize tests, validate executions and generate figures.
It also provides concrete CI/CD/CB pipelines to fully automate the benchmarking step of any application.
