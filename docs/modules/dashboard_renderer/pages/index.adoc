= Dashboard Renderer: Overview

The DashboardRenderer library is a tool designed to generate structured catalog-like reporting sites directly from declarative configuration files in JSON. It is primarily used to organize and present complex data assets, benchmarks, or documentation components in a highly navigable format, typically compatible with systems like Antora.

== What it Does

The library's core function is to map a high-level configuration onto a structured output hierarchy. It manages the organization, presentation logic, and default values for your content, acting as a flexible bridge between raw data definitions and final navigable documentation pages.

The process ensures that complex, related data—such as benchmark results or component specifications—are consistently rendered into reusable, structured assets.

== Installation

The DashboardRenderer is typically installed as part of the main feelpp.benchmarking package using pip.

[source, bash]
----
pip install feelpp-benchmarking
----

== Basic Usage

To render a structured data catalog, you typically define a configuration file (config.json) that specifies the component hierarchy and the views to be used.

=== 1. Define the Configuration (config.json)

Your configuration defines the organization of your output, specifying the component types (repositories) and their instances (components).

[source, json]
----
{
    "dashboard_metadata": { "title": "Employee Performance Benchmarks" },
    "views": { "companies": "teams", "teams": "companies" },
    "repositories": {
        "companies": { "title": "Global Companies", "description": "Organizational units" },
        "teams": { "title": "Development Teams", "description": "Departmental teams" }
    },
    "components": {
        "companies": {
            "TechCorp": { "title": "TechCorp Inc.", "description": "Main Technology Company" }
        },
        "teams": {
            "DevTeamA": { "title": "Development Team A", "description": "Frontend Development Team" }
        }
    },
    "component_map": { "TechCorp": { "DevTeamA": { "path": "reports/employee_data/" } } }
}
----

This simple configuration will generate a catalog with the following pages:

- Global Companies -> TechCorp Inc. -> Development Team A -> [employee_report1, ..., employee_reportN]
- Development Teams ->  Development Team A -> TechCorp Inc. -> [employee_report1, ..., employee_reportN]

Where ALL files under the `reports/employee_data/` directory will be created using cards.

Initially, rendered files will be empty if a template is not provided. This can be configured following the instructions on the <<Custom Templates>> section.

=== 2. Instantiate and Render

You load the configuration, pass it to the renderer, and specify the output directory.
You can also provide custom "plugins" to process data before render-time.

[source, python]
----

class VersionPlugin:
    @staticmethod
    def process(template_data):
        return {"feelpp_benchmarking_version":feelpp.benchmarking.__version__}

def main_cli():

    #Instantiate the dashboard, adding the feelpp_benchmarking_version to the template-accessible data.
    dashboard = Dashboard( "config.json", plugins=[ VersionPlugin ] )

    #Render the catalog dashboard under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages`
    dashboard.render("docs/modules/ROOT/pages")
